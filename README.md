Smart Health Monitoring System

This project involves the design and implementation of a portable, microcontroller-based Smart Health Monitoring System using Arduino Uno. 
The system integrates a MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor and an LM35 temperature sensor to continuously monitor heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen saturation (SpOâ‚‚), and body temperature. 
All vital signs are displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD, and a real-time LED alert system is triggered if any health parameters exceed critical thresholds. 
Designed to be wearable or handheld, this device provides early warnings for potential health anomalies, making it ideal for personal health monitoring in both urban and rural settings. 
The system is low-cost, energy-efficient, and easy to replicate, contributing to broader access to essential healthcare diagnostics.
